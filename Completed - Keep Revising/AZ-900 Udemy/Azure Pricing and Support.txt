Azure Subscription:
- Subscription is a billing unit
- Users have access to one or more subscriptions, with different roles
- All resources consumed by a subscription will be billed to the owner
- Can be used to organize resources into completely distinct accounts
- Management Groups: Groups can have subgroups and each group can have multiple subscriptions (Hierachical)

-------------------------------

Planning and Management Costs:
- Purchase from Microsoft: Pay as you go 
- Enterprise Agreement: Negotiated minimum spend Annual Custom Prices

Purchase from a Microsoft Partner:
- Microsoft Cloud Solution Provider (CSP)
- Azure Free account : azure.microsoft.com/free | 200$ credit for 30 days | 12 months of free services
- Some services are always free

Factors Affecting Costs:
- Different services are billed based on different factors
- Free Services: Resource Groups, VNet, LoadBalancer (Basic), Azure AD (basic), Network security Groups,
  Free-tier Web Apps (upto 10)
- Pay per usage (consumption model)
- Opportunity for cost savings:
	- E.g Azure Functions:
		- 1 million executions free per month
		- 0.2$ per million executions
		- Cheapest VM is 20$ per month
	So consider app cost when designing, Can the app desgined as a FunctionBased App, or does it need a server

- Pay per usage Services
	- Functions
	- Logic Apps
	- Storage (pay per GB)
	- Outbound Bandwidth
	- Cognitive Services API
- Pay for Time (per second)
	- Per second billing means billing stops when the VM is stopped * 
		(but other things like storage, etc, may still be running)
- Stability in Pricing
	- Pay a fixed price per month for computing power or storage capacity
	- Whether you use it or not
	- Discounts for 1 year or 3 year commitment in VM (reserved instances)
	- Multi-tenant or isolated Environment
- Pay for Bandwidth
	- First 5GB is free (Outbound)
	- Inbound is free
- Bandwidth costs : Each zone has its own pricing for outbound data (per GB)
- 1 PB of data = $52,000
- Zone (Geographical Groupiong) 
	1 : US, EU, Canada, UK, France
	2 : Australia, Asia , Japan, Korea, India
	3 : Brazil
	DE 1 : Germany

Total Cost of Ownership calculator (TCO): azure.microsoft.com/pricing/tco/calculator
- The cost of a server is more than just the cost of the hardware
	- Electriciy
	- Cooling
	- Internet Connectivity
	- Rack space
	- Setup Labor
	- Maintenance Labor
	- Backup

Best Practices for Minimizing Azure Costs:
- Azure Advisor Cost Tab
- Auto shutdown on dev/qa resources
- Utilize cool/archive storage where possible (Hot Store vs Cool Store)
- Reserved Instances: Save a certain percent of money by reserving VM (by commiting through a contract, and hybrid licenses)
- Configure alerts when billing exceeds an expected level
- Use Policy to restrict access to certain expensive resources
- Auto Scaling Resources
- Downsize when resources over-provisioned
- Ensure every resource has an owner (tags) [Set policy so that every resource has a tag, 
  so we can know why it is being used

- Another free tool for checking your spending
- Budgeting

------------------------------------------------

Service Level Agreements (SLA):
- Financial Agreement
- Guarantees that Microsoft makes
- 10% credit if the guarantee fails
- each resource has a SLA

Composite SLA:
- Multiple SLAs covering a solution
- Dependancies on the resource SLAs
	- Azure AD, Premium - 99.9
	- 2 VM, In Availability Set - 99.95
	- Azure SQL DB, Basic Tier - 99.99%
	- Azure Storage, LRS Storage reads - 99.9

Calculating Composite SLA:
	- Assuming no redundancy, the Composite SLA (for above) solution:
	- 99.9 * 99.95 * 99.99 * 99.99 = 99.74% SLA

Introducing Redundancy:
- Assuming storage account is fully replicated in another region, and can fallback to reading from a second location
- Storage account SLA becomes: 1 - (0.001 * 0.0001) = 99.9999%
- Updated Composite SLA : 99.84%
