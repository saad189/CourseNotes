Securing Network Connectivity:

Azure Firewall: (Application Gateway, WAF, L7 LB)
- Can detect XSS, SQL injections etc..
- Valid Requests are sent to the next Interface (Load balancer, etc..)


Azure DDoS Protection:
- Always on Monitoring, Automatic Mitigation, L7 Protection, Globally deployed [BASIC]
- Protection policies for you VNet, (Loggin, telemetry, alerting), Resource cost scale protection [Standard]


Network Security Group (NSG):
In resource manager, create Virtual NET you can apply nsg to it
Consider Scenario:
Virtual Network Contains (FrontEnd + Backend)
- FrontEnd Subnet : Has its own NSG
- BackEnd Subnet : Has its own NSG
- In case of Private Net, NSG can block open internet , allowing only gateway pass (VPN)

Inbound NSG rules Protect a Destination IP addresses and Port

ASG (Application Security Group) , can group resource by type (i.e All VMs)


User Defined Routes (UDR):
Force traffic over a route
Force traffic to go a certain route, like through a Firewall, or over a corportate network


Choose an appropriate Azure Security Solution:
- All virtual network subnets should use NSG
- It's a strong lock on windows and doors that you don't use
- DDoS Protection (usually after an attack)
- Application Gateway with WAF
- Security through Layers , multiple layers

--------------------------------------

Azure Identity Services:

The Difference between Authentication and Authorization:

Authentication: User has to prove who they are (user id, password)
Authorization: Ensuring that a User is Permitted to Perform an Action
No longer admin access , thats old :D 

Azure Active Directory: [Like one password for everything connected to AD]
- Identity as a Service: IDaaS
- Microsoft's Preferred Solution for Identity Management
- Complete Solution for Managing Users, Group, Roles (Assign permissions)
- Single-Sign on (saad18910@hotmail.com)
- Synchronize with your corporate AD (Not directly linked to Single Sign on, 
					but it can be synced with corporate AD | mahm)

Azure Multi-Factor Authentication:
- First factor in your User Id
- Second Factor is Password (hopefully its unique)
- Third (now its multi-factor), usually your phone: sms, Authenticator app, phone call (Still vulnerable to Spoofing)

--------------------------------------

Security tools and Features:

Azure Security:
Physcial vs Digital Security
Shared Security Model

Azure AD: Active Directory [Foundational Design]
MFA (MultiFactor Authentication)
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Authorization for multiple features
Layered Approach: (Security Layers):
	- Data (VNET Endpoint), APP (API Management), 
	- Compute (Limit Remote Desktop Access), Windows Update
	- Network (NSG, Use of Subnets, Deny All by default)
	- Perimeter (DDoS, Firewalls)
	- Identity & Access - Azure AD
	- Physical (Door Locks, Key Cards)


Azure Security Centre Usage Scenarios:
Unified Security management and advanced protection
Free and Standart Tier

Key Vault:
Central, Secure Repository for Your Secrets, Certificates and Keys
- API Keys, Secrets, Certificates , etc...
- Authroize key to certain users
- Create key, Certificates (Import)
- Administrator with Azure Subscription creates and manages valut and keys: Key Vault -> Uri for Keys -> Azure Developers
									      -> Usage logging for keys -> Security Admin

Azure Information Protection (AIP):
- Apply labels to emails and documents
- Confidential, Super Confidential, Top Secrets
- E.g Office 365 can restrict certain actions on labelled documents

Azure Advaced Threat Protection:
- Monitor and Profile user behavior and activities
- E.G User logging from certain places, and notice irregular behavior
- Protect user identities and Reduce the Attack surface
- Identify Suspicious Activities and Advanced Attacks
- Investigate Alerts and User activities

-----------------------------------------

Azure Governance Methodologies:

Azure Policy:
- Governance
- Create Rules across all of your Azure Resources (Resource Groups)
- Evaluate Compliance to those rules
Examples:
	- Require SQL Server 12.0	
	- Allowed Storage Account SKU [Certain Account Types]
	- Allowed Locations [Certain Regions]
	- Allowed Virtual Machine SKU [Certain VM types, cheaper?]
	- Apply tag and its default Value [billing code]
	- Not allowed resource types
- Create custom Policies using JSON definition

Policy Initiatives:
- A set of policies grouped together
- Every resource and resource group must have these five tags
- Grouped together to act as a policy initiative

Role Based Access Control (RBAC):
- Microsoft Recommended solution
- Create roles that represent the common tasks of the job
- Accountant, Developer, Business, Lead
- Assign granular permissions to these roles
- Assign users to that role ( People can have mutiple Roles )
- Do not assign granular permissions to an individual (rather assign permissions to role)
- Built-In Roles : Reader, Contributor, Owner

Locks:
- Read Only, Can Not Delete 
- To prevent accidental deletes and Updates
- Apply to resource, (A locked resource cannot be deleted)
- Using RBAC, you can restrict who has access to locks


Azure Advisor security Assistance:
- Recommends (every few hours), Usage, Security, etc..


Azure BluePrints:
- Azure Subscription templates with Roles and Policies already Defined

------------------------------------------

Monitoring and Reporting Options:
- Azure Monitor [Records Logs, and Metrics (Memory and CPU Utilization)
	- Insights -> Visualize -> Analyze -> Respond -> Integrate
- Azure Service Health
	- Records Issues with Azure Data Centres, and gives feedback of any worldwide issues

Monitor vs Health
- Azure Monitor collects all the data for you to analyze and create alerts on
- Specific to your application, you actions
- Azure Service Health are general alerts across all of Azure

-----------------------------------------

Privacy, Compliance and Data Protection Standards:

Compliance Terms such as GDPR, ISO, NIST:
- Many Standards worldwide
- Microsoft claims to be in compliance with many of them
- Has tools to help you be in compliance with others

General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR):
- Set of Rules designed to give EU citizens more control over their personal data
- Affects companies outside of EU that handle EU citizen's data
- Data has to be collected legally
- Data has to be protected from Misuse
- Reporting obligations if data is mishandled


ISO (International Organization for Standardization):
- ISO 9001:2015 is for Quality Management System (QMS)
- ISO/IEC 20000-1

NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF):
- National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)
- Audited for compliance to security and privacy processes


Micorosft Privacy Statement: privacy.microsoft.com

Trust Center:
- Portal about Standards, Documentation, Privacy Statements

Service Trust Portal: Specific, Compliance Manager, Pen Tests, Azure BluePrints

Compliance Manager:
- Workflow-Based risk assessment tool to help you manage regulatory compliance
- Goto Service Trust Portal (Shows score of your compliance)

Azure Government Services:
- Separate Account
- For US gov agencies, federal, state, etc..

- Isolated Data centers seperate for Public cloud
- Different URLs for connection to storage, functions, etc..

Azure Germany Services:
- Separate Account
- Data remains in Germany
- Strictest EU data protection
