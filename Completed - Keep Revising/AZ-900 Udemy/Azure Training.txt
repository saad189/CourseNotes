Azure Training : Azure 900

Module 1: Why cloud Services
- On-demand Self-Service: Consider the need for a dev environment
	- Just go to the portal and deploy the machine of your choice, easy
	- One thing to consider the Coorporate account (need admin access)
- Ubiquitous network Access: Your services on the go from the portal
- Location transparent resource pooling: Your machines in any part of the world
	- Region specific and accessible across the world
- Rapid Elasticity: Scalability and Reductibility automatically (Azure manages this | Automate Scaling == Elasticity)
	- What I think is : Increase and Reduce automatically
	- Think about problems that cannot be resolved by just adding more resources
	- More Resources added [ Scale Up ]
	- Remove Resources [ Scale Down ]
	- Remove Instances [ Scale In ]
	- Create more instances of the Virutal Machine [ Scale Out ]
- Measured Service | Consumption Based : Payment options, you pay as much as you use ( not how much you buy )

Key Concepts and Terms : 
- High Availability : No Down-time : Cancels Disaster Recovery? => Active | Active Cluster
- Scalibility
- Elasticity
- Agility
- Fault Tolerance : Backup? Copy? [Keep working but can have down-time (minutes - days)]
- Disaster Recovery: Slow but almost like Fault Tolerance [But Secondary Site (Mirror Approach)] => Active | Passive Cluster (Distributed Computing)
- Global Reach
- Customer Latency Capabilities
- Predictive Cost Considerations
- Security
--------------------------------------------

Economies of Scale:
- The ability to do things less expensively and more efficiently when operating at a larger scale
- Benefits passed on to the customer


CapEx vs OpEx:

- Capital Expenditure
	- Spend on physical infrastructure up front
	- Deduct the expense from your tax bill over time
	- High upfront cost, value of investment reduces over time
- Operational Expenditure:
	- Spend on services or products as needed
	- Deduct the expense from your tax bill in the same year
	- No upfront cost, Pay As You Use

Office <Version> vs Office 365

--------------------------------------------

Consumption Based Model
--------------------------------------------
Types of Cloud Models

- Public Cloud : No CapEx , Agility, Consumption-based model
	- Owned by a cloud services provider or hosting provider
	- Provides services to multiple organizations and users
	- Access via a secure network connection
- Private Cloud: Control, Security
	- Owned and operated by the organization that uses cloud resources
	- Oragnizations craete a cloud environment in thier data center
	- Self-service access to compute resources provided to users within the organization
	- Organizations responsible for operating the services they provide
- Hybrid Cloud: Flexibility, Compliance [ with legal requirements ]
	- Combines Public and Private Clouds to allow application to run in the most appropriate location
----------------------------------------------


Cloud Services: 
- IAAS (Infrastructre as a Service): Flexibility
	- Most basic cloud computing services catagory
	- Build as pay-as-you-go IT infrastructure by renting servers (Azure)
	- Instant computing infrastructure 
	- Servers and Storage | Networking firewalls/Security | Datacenter physical plant/building
	
- PAAS (Product as a Service): ???????
- PaaS (Platform as a Service) : Productivity

	- Operating System
	- Environment for building testing and deploying software applications
	- Helps create applications quickly, without focusing on managing underlying infrastructure
- SAAS (Software as a Service) : 
	- Paas + Hosted Application + Apps
	- Centrally hosted and managed software for end users
	- Users connect to and use cloud-based apps over the internet
	- e.g : Office 365, Email, and Calenders


---------------------------------------------------------

Cloud computing models and Responsibilities:
IAAS: Host (Devlop + Runtime, Operating Systems, VMs)
PAAS: Develop (Data & Access, Applications)
SAAS: Consume (Data & Access)

----------------------------------------------------------

Core Azure Services: Module 2
