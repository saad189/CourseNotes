High Availability:
- Expressed as a percentage it's ability of a system to respond to users
- 99.99% Four nines, 4 minutes per month (down time)

Scalability:
- The ability of a system to handle growth of users or work
- Graph where Max capacity is exceeded by number of concurrent users, will have a intersection point of app failure
- Want the ability to grow easily, hence highly scalable, or if its difficult then its not really scalable

Elasticity:
- The ability of a system to automatically grow and shrink based on application demand
- Consider efficiency

Agility:
- The ability to change rapidly based on changes to market or environment

Fault Tolerance:
- The ability of a system to handle faults like power, networking, or hardware failures
- Consider copies of servers

Disaster Recovery:
- The ability of a system to recover from failure within a period of time, and how much data is lost
- Period of time to recover
- Amount of data lost/recovered

Economies of Scale:
- It's cheaper for Microsoft to run a server than you can ever achieve yourself
- Efficient ways to run servers (by vendors)
- Thus they can offer cheaper services as compared to your own

Capital Expenditure (CapEx) and Operational Expenditure (OpEx):
- CapEx is money invested in assets (like computers) that return investment over time
- Upfront money for later ROI
- OpEx is money spent every day on operating expenses
- User Pay per hour (after each month)

Consumption-Based Model:
- Cost is calculated per usage as opposed to Time-based Model (money per hour/sec, etc..)

Paradigms for Hosting Applications : IaaS, Paas, SaaS
- Infrastructure as a Service:
	- Virtual Machines, Networking, Load Balancers, Firewalls
- Platform as a Service:
	- Upload code packages and have them run, without access to the hardware
- Software as a Service:
	- Software is already deployed [e.g SQL server already deployed, MS Word etc]
	- Access to configuration only

- Traditional IT manges everything: App,Data,Runtime,Middleware,OS,Virtualization,Servers,Storage,Networking

- IaaS:	App,Data,Runtime,Middleware [You manage this, rest is managed by IaaS] Uptil OS IaaS will provide everything
- PaaS: App,Data [You manage] Uptil Runtime PaaS manages
- SaaS: You only configure the App, all of it is managed by Azure/Vendor

Public, Private and Hybrid Clouds:
- Public Cloud: 
	- Computing services offered over the public internet, anyone can sign up
- Private Cloud:
	- Computing services offered to only select users; internal or corporate cloud (Company, Sales Process)
- Hybrid Cloud:
	- Combination of public and private clouds; scale private infrastructure to the cloud
	- Mostly running in your environment [Privacy, Control] , but then u need to scale, so you add public cloud services 
	(Elasticity and Scalability)

Differences:
Public: straightforward
Private: your own hardware and a sales process is involved
Hybrid: Mixture of both
