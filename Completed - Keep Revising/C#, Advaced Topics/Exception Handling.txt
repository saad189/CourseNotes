Stack Trace: Sequence of Methods called, until the exception was thrown

Exception : parent of all exception

Exception Types: Generic to Specific : System.Exception -> System.ArithmeticExcetion -> System.DivideByZeroException.

when using try {} catch{}. You can catch Multiple exceptions, but order is : Specific to Generic

- After Try, Catch, we have finally {}
- Usually for cleanup [Dispose]

Better Approach:
            try
            {
                using (var streamReader = new StreamReader(@"C:\file.zip"))
                {
                    streamReader.ReadToEnd();
                }
            }
            catch (Exception ex)
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Error Occured:", ex);
            }

Create Your Own Exception:
- When the exception is not of use to the reader, and you want to send a different exception (Your own)
