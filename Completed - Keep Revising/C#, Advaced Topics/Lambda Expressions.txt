Assign Lambda to a delegate. That is how it is supposed to work

Func<int,int> square = number => number * number;

// () =>
// x => 
// (x,y,z) => 

Predicate:
- A delegate to a method that gets a type T object and returns a boolean on condition
e.g :  books = books.FindAll(b => b.Price < 10); [where : b => b.Price < 10 is a predicate]
	Similar to Func(Book book) { return book.Price < 10; }
