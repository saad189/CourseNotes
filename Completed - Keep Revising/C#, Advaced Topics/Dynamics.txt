Programming Languages:
- Statically Typed Languages : [Type Resolution at Complie Time] : C#, Java
- Dynamically Typed Languages : [Type Resolution at Run Time] : Ruby, Python, Javascript

C# Initially was static, but after .NET 4 (dynamic capability was added)

CLR : Common Language Runtime -> .net virutal machine -> IntermediateLanguage -> Machine Code

with C# Dynamic Language Runtime -> CLR 

Dynamic type: Resolved at runtime, furthermore their types can be changed too: stirng to int 

Note: var is resolved at compile time, dynamic at runtime. BUT: 
	    dynamic a = 10;
            dynamic b = 5;
            var c = a + b;
Now var is dynamic.

If at runtime the dynamic time matches a static object, it can be assigned to the static object without any casting
