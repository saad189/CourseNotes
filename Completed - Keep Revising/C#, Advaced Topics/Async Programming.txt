Synchronous Program:
- Line by Line
- Program has to wait for a function execution to complete, before moving ahead

Asynchronous Program:
- Program Execution continues to the next line without waiting for async function to complete

Improves responsiveness of your application

Use it when the call will have delays : DbAccess, etc...

Traditional : Multi-threading, Callbacks

New approach Since Net 4.5
- Async/Await

Task : Encapsulates state of Async operation?

await operator: Not exactly blocking
- Its not blocking, just a marker for compiler (to let it know its a costly operator)
- Returns CONTROL back to the caller of the method
- Stops execution of the current method till the await call is complete

Scale Up vs Scale Out

Scale up: Async ?
Scale out : add physcial servers
