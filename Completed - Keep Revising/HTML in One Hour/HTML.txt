Key Concepts:
- URL, HTTP, DOM, etc...
- HTML : Hypertext Markup Language
- CSS  : Cascading Stylesheet

Framework: Contains reusable code

WebWorks:

URL: Uniform Resource Locator
Resources:
    - Web pages (HTML documents)
    - Images
    - Video files
1. Browser (Client) -> Server
- HTTPS : HTTP + Encryption
- Request -> Response

HTML is for structure
CSS is for Beautifying it

/* Set border radius to half of image width, for round image */
        /* Image will go to the left side */

Enabling Formatting on Save:
    Go to settings in Code -> Search 'format on save'

In Dev tools, you can check on top right of the control, to
see where a certain style has been applied

To Validate your WebPage's HTML:

- validator.w3.org

To Validate your WebPage's CSS:

- http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/


Tags:

- &lt; < (less than)
- &gt; > (greater than)
- &copy; C
- &nbsp; glue two words together
- dev.w3.org, to check for all entities

= view port is visible area on the monitor 
meta:description -> displays the description on search engine

Linking the WebPage to another external link:

-   <a href="https://google.com" target="_blank">Google</a>
- target="_blank" ensures new tab

- Jump to Section on Page:
    - Define id, e.g: id="section-css"
    - href="#section-css"
- Free Images:
    - unsplash.com


    img{
              width: 200px;
              height: 200px;
              object-fit: cover;
        }
- Using object-fit: cover, will expand the image to fit the container
    (would have been perfect for youtube video issue in daoProptech)
