The Vice:
- As a buyer, you keep flinching and trying to lower the price by saying :
 "You will have to do better than that".
- Repeat until you reach (your) limit budget or lower
- As a seller, if the Vice is being used on you, respond by:
 "How much EXACTLY are you looking to purchase this for?"
- Key as a seller is to get the real number out.

The Salami:
- Ask for little things [Whats mine is mine, what's yours is negotitable]
- Take things back, as if trading back
- Attack back (using money)
- Don't be afraid to back out (I am afraid I can't agree to this)
  (A little bit unprofessional, but if necessary, do it)

Product Knocking:
- Its not really quite what I wanted
- Buyers knock the product to lower the price
- Respond : "That is why the price is this reasonable"

Reluctant Buyer/Seller:
- I don't really want to buy this, but if the price was good I would
- Can be used as a seller, "I suppose I could fit you in my schedule"
- Remember its just a game

Section 6 Trading:

The Meaning of Win/Win:
- You can't win-win on price (Zero-Sum Game)
- But you can win on Trading (e.g -> Buy 5 of these, or buy this thing as well, or promote my product)
- Prepare the tradables

How to Trade:
- Use phrase : "If you ... then I/We"
- Hide what's valuable to you [Don't make a big deal out of it]
- Don't undervalue things either

Small Steps:
- Move in small steps (e.g 4800 -> 4700, not 4000)
- This implies you are close to the limit
- Add tradables each time as well

The Hedge Story: 
- Set your limit (Walk away point)
- Negotitating should be About Being Nice
- Small steps, and leave space for walk away point
- Presist!
- Jusitfy your Pricing
- Sell Yourself
- Trade : Make me Tea, Take away clippings, Book me regularly, Notice: HedgeTrimmed by Dave,
 Recommend me to Neighbour


-------------------------------

Section 7 Closing:

- Don't let your profit slip away

Final Offer:
- "That's my final offer"
	- If it's false: Don't use it
	- If it's true : You are bound to use it everytime
- Asking them : Don't ask them for final offer

Split the Difference:
- Don't break at this phrase
- They have given up and you can push it
- You can split the difference of the difference (100 - 90 -> 95 -> 95 - 90 -> 92)
- If they dont break, you can use the split, split

The Nibble:
- They might bring in extras that you donot expect
- Ask them, are there any extras that I don't know about
- It is dishonest as a seller, watch out as a buyer
- Don't leave loose ends (e.g location, travel, extra items , like batteries)
- Counter Nibble
- Don't let it slide, Don't let them get away with it

The Quivering Pen:
- Done before the deal, Dodgy not dishonest
- You CAN say no (Other person is also keen to sign the deal)

Should You walk away?:
- Depends on the walk away limit
- Try Trading

How to Practise:
- Practice makes perfect
- Try fleamarker, carboot sale, etc...
- Mess around, Play
- Try it on something that you donot want
- Try on something you can't afford (But do want)
- Try on something that is cheaper somewhere else
-
