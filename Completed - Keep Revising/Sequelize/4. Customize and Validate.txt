Customize Model:

- e.g: freezeTableName (true -> model name matches table name)

docs.sequelizejs.com -> seach -> freezeTableName and search similar
options

timestamps (createdAt and updatedAt can be managed)

These options are added in either sequlize Object or Table Definition

1. add define : { } in sequlize
2. add 3rd param in table

----------------

Attribute Qualifiers:

- Customize attributes before they become columns
    - primaryKey | defaultValue | NOT NULL

- attribute.validate -> to validate the data of the attribute 

----------------

Attribute Validations:

validator.js | extension | custom-validation 

- check docs -> validations 
Object : {
    validate:{
        args: [],
        msg: ''
    }
}

----------------

Hooks:

Lifecycle events, called before and after events in sequlize are
executed

[Before Validation, After Validation, Before Creation, After Creation]
[beforeValidate: () => {},afterValidate: (),beforeCreate: (),afterCreate: ()]

3rd param of Model 

Can be used to hash stuff
