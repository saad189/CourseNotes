Aggregate Functions:
- Perform calculations on data within a column and returns one result row
- Can use GROUP BY clauses to group the results by one (or more) columns
- Can use a HAVING (similar to where in a select, for filtering)
- COUNT, SUM, MIN, MAX, AVG

------------------------

COUNT:

select count(*) from customers;
select COUNT(first_name) from customers;
- It doesn't count NULL VALUES

-------------------------

SUM:

- Sum values of a column (NUMERIC only)
- select SUM(no_seats) from rooms;

-------------------------

Min and Max:

- Max and Min values from a column;
select MAX(length_min) from films;
select MIN(length_min) from films;

--------------------------

Average:

select AVG(length_min) from films;
select AVG(length_min) from films where length_min > 120;
select SUM(length_min)/COUNT(length_min) from films;


---------------------------

Excercise:

1. select Count(*) from bookings where customer_id = 10;
2. select Count(*) from screenings s join films f on s.film_id = f.id where f.name = 'Blade Runner 2049';
3. select count(distinct(customer_id)) from bookings;

---------------------------

Grouping Data:

select customer_id, Count(id) from bookings 
group by customer_id;

- select <group_by_column>, Function(column) from bookings group by <group_by_column>
- number of columns to group by (in select) must also be in group by clause

SELECT f.name, s.start_time, c.first_name, c.last_name, COUNT(b.id) FROM films f
JOIN screenings s ON f.id = s.film_id
JOIN bookings b ON s.id = b.screening_id
JOIN customers c ON b.customer_id = c.id
GROUP BY f.name, s.start_time, c.first_name, c.last_name
ORDER BY s.start_time;

---------------------------

Having Clause:

- If you use GROUP BY, you cannot use WHERE
- USE HAVING clause

select customer_id, screening_id, count(id) from bookings
group by customer_id, screening_id 
having customer_id = 10;

Note: the statement in HAVING Clause must be included in group by and select as well.
---------------------------

Exercise:
1. select b.customer_id, count(r.id) from reserved_seat r
join bookings b On r.booking_id = b.id
group by b.customer_id;

2. select f.name, f.length_min, count(s.film_id) from films f
join screenings s on s.film_id = f.id
group by f.name,f.length_min
having f.length_min > 120;
