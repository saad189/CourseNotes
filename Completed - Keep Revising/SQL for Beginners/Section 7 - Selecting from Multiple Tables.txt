What are Joins:

- Joins allow you to retrieve data from multiple tables in a single select statement, to join two tables
  there needs to be a related column between them.

Types:

- Inner Join:	Will retrieve data only when there is matching values in both sides
- Left Join: Will retrieve data from left table and matching rows from the right table
- Right Join: Will retrieve data from right table and matching rows from the left table
- Outer (Full) Join: Will retrieve all data from both tables

-----------------------------

Inner Join:

- select products.name, orders.order_time from orders 
Inner Join products on orders.product_id = products.id

- select <table>.<column>.... from <table>
Inner Join <table_left> on <table>.<column> = <table>.<column>

- select p.name, o.order_time from orders o 
join products p on o.product_id = p.id;

- select p.name,p.price, o.order_time from orders o 
join products p on o.product_id = p.id 
order by o.order_time;


------------------------------

Left_Join:

- Table order matters when writing left or right join


update orders set customer_id = null where id =1 ;
select o.id, c.phone_number, c.last_name, o.order_time from orders o 
left join customers c on o.customer_id = c.id 
order by o.order_time
limit 10;

select o.id, c.phone_number, c.last_name, o.order_time from customers c
left join orders o on c.id = o.customer_id
order by o.order_time
limit 10;

------------------------------

Right_Join:
select o.id, c.phone_number, c.last_name, o.order_time from customers c
right join orders o on c.id = o.customer_id
order by o.order_time
limit 10;

------------------------------

Joining More than two tables:

select p.name, p.price, c.first_name, c.last_name, o.order_time from products p
join orders o on p.id = o.product_id
join customers c on c.id = o.customer_id;

// One Table has to be the link between two non-related tables


-----------------------------

Excercise:

1. select o.id, c.phone_number from orders o 
join customers c on c.id = o.customer_id where o.product_id = 4;

2. select p.name, o.order_time from products p 
join orders o on p.id = o.product_id
where p.name = 'Filter' and o.order_time between '2017-01-15' and '2017-02-14';

3. select p.name, p.price, o.order_time from products p 
join orders o on p.id = o.product_id
join customers c on c.id = o.customer_id
where c.gender = 'F' and o.order_time between '2017-01-01' and '2017-01-31';
