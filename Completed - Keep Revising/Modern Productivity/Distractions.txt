The Truth about Multitasking:

- Its like a slot machine in our pockets.
- Apps intentionally use loaders to build anticipation
- Designed to keep you hooked.
- NOT CONDUCIVE TO PRODUCTIVITY

WHAT CAN YOU DO :
1. JUST QUIT (Complete Elimination)
- TAKE 30 DAYS OF SOLID WITHDRAWL OF SOCIAL MEDIA (TAKE THIS CHALLANGE)
2. SCHEDULE A TIME :
- Allow yourself to use the apps for 30 minutes on a scheduled time

DOING ONE THING IS ESSENTIAL.

How Meetings Impact Your Productivity:

How to Leverage Other People's Time to Get More Done:

Opportunity Cost:  Constantly analyze what you are doing with your time. 
- What else you could be doing?
- If a thing needs to be done, but appears a waste of time: Try Outsourcing it. [May not be viable]
- Assign Value to your time, if it is more than the money it costs to outsource, then outsource it.
