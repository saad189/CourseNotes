What are Components? And Why Is React All About Them?:

- For Building User Interfaces
- Divides code into Components
    - Reusability
    - Separation of Concerns

------------------

React Code is Written in a 'Declarative Way'!:

- Declarative Approach: Define the desired target state(s) and let
    React figure out the actual JavaScript DOM instructions
    (Oppositely, you would have to define every element and its update code as well)

------------------

Create a new React Project:
- create-react-app (from Facebook)
- npx create-react-app <app-name>
