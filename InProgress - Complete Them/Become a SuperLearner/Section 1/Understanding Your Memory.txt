Why We need to Improve Our Memory First:

- Working Memory:
- Very short term memory that allows us to interact with and process information, (i.e listening to a complete sentence)
- Our brains use several different types of buffers

Short Term Mermory:
- Memory function used to keep information for 15-20 seconds

Both are the primary bottlenecks

How we store information
- Memory is created via connection between nueron.
- We have 2.5 PetaByte of memory in the brain
