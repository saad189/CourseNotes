There are 3 Stages of Memory
- Encoding 
- Storage
- Retrieval

Short-Pauses (after reading 1 or 2 paragraphs)
Longer Pauses every 10 minutes or less [Review]

Your Brain needs to periodically repeat required memory

Pauses for a play-back
Good idea to review (markers of) books and material you have read, alot earlier

Not all markers have to be visual

----------------------------------------------
Marker Details:
- Rich details, colors, textures, etc..
- A specific concept or Idea
- Logically and clearly interconnected
- More the better
- Each significant Idea of Paragraph needs a marker
- Then one marker for the collective?
- Markers are specific and Detailed
- Detail OVER Concept (you can go from detail to concept, not reverse)

- Good Markers Prioritize Solution over the problem/Question
- Connects to Existing Knowledge

- Create Marker for every single detail that seems to be important
	- People
	- Dates
	- Formulas
	- Etc..
#BottomUpMethod
---------------------------------------------

Logical & Creative Markers:
- Emotions
- Punctuations
- Diagrams, Symbols, Trignometry

- What is your opinion about the Information (for which you want to create a marker)
- What works best for you?

Practice Marker creation habit
- Bookmark for your life
