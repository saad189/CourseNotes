Storytelling Tips:

- Know Your Listener : What is listener's attention span and to get to the point quickly
- Be Personal but Not Confessional : Not too personal, be on point, don't touch topics that 
				     can offend
- Be Specific : Task -> Action -> Result [ this was the task, what action i took, what the 
					   result was ]
- Aim For A Home Run : Focus on the problem, Why should they listen to you (uniqueness ->
  credibility), directly inform, Call to Action
- Reenact your Story, Don't Just Tell It : Use Actual Dialogue, Short -> Present Tense
- Build a Story Bank : Gather stories, think about backgrounds [yours, clients, work, family, friends], Write them down
	- Catagorize: Each story by the point it makes, Practice to be comfortable with telling the story "out loud"
