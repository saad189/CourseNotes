Why Audience Comes First - Always

Three Step Process of Audience Analysis:

1. 
- Get to know your Audience
- Connection , Credibility , Confidence
- Consider the Spotlight, Stop thinking about it
- Pivot it Outward (Who is in the room with me, Value them)!

- Who is in my audience: Consider the groups of people in there
- What do the audience want: Understand the Audience Desires in play
- How do the Audience Feel about the Topic: Adjust your tone accordingly
- What does your audience already know: What to avoid to prevent boring them
- What do they need to know: What gaps do I need to fill to let them understand
- What questions do they have: Consider the tough questions that you hope they won't ask
			       , get them on the table, It's really important
- What parts makes the audience skeptical: Don't ignore it, Identify and address it

Set Your Three Part Speaking Goal

- How do you want your audience to FEEL as a result of your presentation?
- What do you want your audience to DO after hearing you speak?

3.
Craft Your 12-Word Message

- Use 12 words to explain the essence of your presentation
- Doesn't matter the time of the presentation
- It is the guiding light, the molder
- The IBI test: Interesting But Irrelevant
