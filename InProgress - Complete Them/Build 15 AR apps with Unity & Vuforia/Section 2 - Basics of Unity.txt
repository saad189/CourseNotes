Intro:
- Moving Objects
- Adding Texture
- Some wierd Concept
- Scripting

Understanding Different Panels in Unity:

- Left Side: Panel (Hierarchy) shows all the Objects
    - 3D Objects -> Game Objects
    - 2D Objects -> Sprites
    - New Project:
        - Main Camera + Directional Light are the default Objects created

- Middle:
    - Scene Panel (Shows the Whole Thing :D)
    - Game Panel
        - Preview the Output of a game/application
    - Asset Store
        - Assets online

- Right Side: Inspector Panel
    - View properties of a selected Game Object
    -
- Bottom:  Projects Panel
    - Asset Container 
    - Contains Scenes
        - A Scene is like a game level
        - e.g. 10 Scenes = 10 Game Levels
        - Pages are also Scenes
    - Console Panel:
        - Console

Moving, Rotating & Scaling GameObjecets in Unity
- Top Left: Contains A bunch of Tools (Select, Move, Rotate )
- Top left, + Sign, to create new items
- Creating A new Object, (3d Cube)
- Axes:
    - Red: X-Axis
    - Blue: Z-Axis
    - Green: Y-Axis

    - Changing them, changes the Position Properties' Values: X,Y,Z
    - (0,0,0) = Universal Centre Position
    - Centre Point = Pivot (Joined by Red, Green, Blue )

- Rotate Tool Works on Rotation Property: (X,Y,Z);
- Scale Tool Works on Scale Property (More like 3D Scale Tool)
    - Selecting middle cube -> All Axes will be altered with this
- Rect Tool (More like 2D Scale Tool)
    - Will Change to X,Y or Y,Z based on View

:: View: Alt + Left Mouse + Move
:: Measurement: Unity Unit

- Move, Rotate, Scale Tool -> Full Verstality
