What is Augmented Reality:
Technology that superimposes Computer generated images on the user's view of the real world
(Mixed View (Tech + Reality))

Basically -> Adding Computer generated images/objects, added into the real world

Devices: Meta 2 | Microsoft Holo-lens

Example: Pokemon GO

Requirements of the Mobile:
- Camera
- Compass
- GPS (Global Positioning Sensor)
- Accelerometer

Types of AR:
1. Markerbased AR  #ImageRecognitionAR
2. Markerless AR
3. Projection based AR
4. Superimposition based AR

Markerbased AR:
- A marker is needed to project the 3D object (QR Code, 2D Image)

Markerless AR:
- Recognizes Real life surfaces to project

Projection Based AR:
- Projects light to create object 

Superimposition based AR:
- A real object is copied/replaced with the 3D Object

VR vs AR:

- Virtual Reality is replacement of real world with a virtual world
- Devices: Occulus Rift, Google Cardboard Box, etc...
- Lens use 3D image trick
- Sensors in VR:
    - Magnetometer -> Compass for North Recognition
    - Accelerometer -> Change in Position | Landscope
    - Gyroscope Sensor -> Position of the phone (Accuracy) | Very Important for Head tracking

Comparison:
- VR is complete replacement | AR is Addition of new reality to real world
- VR doesnt need Camera | AR is dependent of Camera
