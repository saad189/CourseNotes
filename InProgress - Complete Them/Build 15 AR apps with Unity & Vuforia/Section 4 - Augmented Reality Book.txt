Sketching the Images of ARBook:

- Sketch out Images
- Add A lot of Text
- Use Dark Colors (Sketch Pens)
- Add lot of edges and unique points

---------

Importing the License Key:

- Package Registry Location:
    Project -> Packages -> manifest.json
    This contains the dependencies

- To update
    Window -> Package Manager

- Adding License Key:
    - Select AR Camera
    - Open Vuforia Enginer Configuration (Inspector Panel)
    - Reuse ARONE License Key

------------------

Upload Images to Vuforia Database:
- Create Database
- Upload Images

------------------

Customising the Sun Target Image:

- Download Images that have `labelled for reuse` or `labelled for
    reuse with modification
- Every material is Shader, by default it is Dark tint
- For this, Texture -> Unlit -> Texture

Creating Heatwave:
- UnityAssets -> Unity Particle Pack -> Download & Import
- Assets - Effectxamples > Smoke & Steam Effects > Prefabs > GroudFog
- Set Scale to 0.5
- Set Start Color to #FDB813

----------------

Customising the House Image Target:

- Using House Image Target
- Downloaded LowPoly Holiday House Texture
- Downloaded Five Seamless Grass Textures
- Setup the Building | Add Cylinder, apply grass texture accordingly, add trees

----------------

Customising the Car Image Target:
- use car model

----------------

Customising the Ship Image Taget:
- Download: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/shaders/water-shaders-v2-x-149916
- Use Prefabs to adjust for day/night
- After applying the prefab, inspect its shaders
    - Change Texture Tiling and reduce it (e.g 3)
    - This is because such a small scale should show fewer wave tiles (to appear natural)

- Import Boat asset: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/lowpoly-paper-boat-61369
- Rotate with empty object

---------------

Customising the Arrowplane Image Target:
- Download : https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/vehicles/air/super-spitfire-53217
- TIP: Minus Scale will invert the object
- The Aeroplane object is a combination of multiple objects (e.g wings, propeller, etc...)
- Add Rotate Script to propeller, Y = 1000

- Add Translate Script to the Aeroplane, transform.Translate(moveObject * Time.deltaTime);

----------------

Adding and Moving the Cloud objects
- Download: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/awesome-low-poly-fantasy-clouds-97654
- Add Cloud Models (as much as you like)
- Set reverse Translate Script
- Attach to Aeroplane Image Target

----------------

Understanding the Problem behind Aeroplane Image Target:
- As all Image Targets are activated at once, there is a possibility that by the Time
    the user reaches this IT, the plan and the clouds have already disappeared
- ImageTarget Has Script Functions attached to it:
    - On Target Found()
    - On Target Lost()

- Both work like this:
    - '+' -> Attach Object, Add Function
    - e.g: Attach Super_Spitfire, GameObject.SetActive -> True (for Target Found())

----------------

Resetting the Position of AeroPlane Model:

- A wall will be used for collision detection
- The Collider and Collidee both must be 'RigidBody'
- Attach Box Collider (Note there are more collider types available) to the Aeroplane
    - Adjust it (Size + Center)
- Add a TAG to the Cube (Wall), 'AEROPLANEWALL' and set its tag as such
    - for detecting what kind of collision happened

-     NewScript:
Start:
    originalPosition = transform.localPosition;
        // The localPosition of the object, Since it is done at start, 
        the starting position will be grabbed.

    private void OnTriggerEnter(Collider other)
    {
        if (other.gameObject.CompareTag("AEROPLANEWALL"))
        {
            transform.localPosition = originalPosition;
        }
    }
- Basically, When triggered (the collision that is), check for the relevant tag
    (DID THE TRIGGER HAPPEN DUE TO THIS TAG?)
- To make the wall opaque, Create Material
    - Rendering Mode: Fade
    - Color: A = 0;


--------------

Customising the AR Book Cover Image Target:

- Create Prefab of the Entire House Object
- Prefab 'Orignal Prefab' of Car Model, Cloud Objects, AeroPlane
- You can unpack a prefab as well

--------------

Integrating a 3D Text:

- Add 3D text from 3D Objects
- Set Anchor to Middle Center
- You can Download Fonts (as zip) from fonts.google.com
- Add to Project and Drag and Drop to the Font Tab

---------------

Building the AR Book App:
- Adjust Player Settings, and Build
