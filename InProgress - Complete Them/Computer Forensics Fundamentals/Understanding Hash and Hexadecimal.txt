A hash file: 
- algorithm that shows the value of a file
- Any file, folder or drive can be hashed to a hexadecimal value
- There are different types of hashes that can be used

What is the purpose of a hash:
- To show if a file/drive is identical
	- Make filehash on original and copy drive and match them
- To find specific file
	- Example: Matching a file from a USB drive to one on a drive
- To exclude or include files
	- Example: Windows system files that are known, don't need to be searched if they are original hash value
- To find files without having files(known bad files)
	- Example: Hash list are available that have list of known bad files such as explicit images or malware files.
		   The hash can be searched without having to have the known bad files

What are common hash types used in computer forensics

- MD5 (Message-Digest)
	- The MD5 message-digest algorithm is cryptographic hash function that produces 128-bit (16-byte) hash value.
	  An MD5 hash value is typically expressed as a hexadecimal numbers 32 digits long.
	  MD5 has been shown to produce "collisions" where two differnt files could have the same hash value but could
	  be differnt (in content). Though collisiona are rare the more secure SHA-1 and SHA-2 hash algorithms were dev-
	  eloped.
- SHA-1   Secure hash algo, desgined by US NSA, Produces 160-bit (20-byte) hash value. SHA-1 hash value is typically expres-
	  sed as a hexadecimal number, 40 digits long.
- SHA-2   A set of cryptographic hash functions (SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512) designed by NSA, SHA-2 consists of a set
	  of 4 hash functions : 224,256,384 or 512 bits
