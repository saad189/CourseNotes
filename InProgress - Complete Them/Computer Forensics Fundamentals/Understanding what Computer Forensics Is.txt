What is Computer Forensics:
- Processing of Collecting, preserving, analysing and documenting digital media evidence of a crime.
- Goal : to collect digital evidence that can be used in a court of law.

Ways computer can be used in a crime:
- Computers used in the commision of a crime
- Computers used to store evidence of a crime (drug, murder) [Casey Anthony trial]
- Computers used as a means to commit the crime (internet exploitation)
- Computers used to collaborate existing evidence (GPS, phone)

What computer forensics is not:
- Don't trust what you see on TV
- Computer forensics is also not a wild free for all of looking of any crime that may have been committed on the crime
  It is guided through rules and laws that must be followed to the letter or the warrant
- e.g: If you have a warrant for one crime, and you uncover evidence of a different one, then you need warrant for that crime
	before continuing to investigate


Computer Forensics Process:
- Acquiring  - The process of capturing original digital media from a source (Ensuring Write-Corruption, work is done
	       on the copy, not the original (make 2 copy, better practice)

	     - Ensure copy is same: FileHash
- Perserving - Preserving the evidence both through preservation of physical media as well as preserving a "paper trail" of
	       the media

- Analysing  - Inspecting the suspect media for evidence of a crime [Forensics Software is used]

- Reporting  - Producing a report of the digital evidence to show what was found on the drive
