Git Merge:

In master :

git merge feature-branch 
    - will evolve the project to merge with master, but will keep the tree structure

git merge --squash feature-branch
    - packs all the commits of the feature branch into just one commit and adds it 
        to the master (or merging) branch

Note: will have to follow it up, with another commit that solidifies the merge operation


Git Rebase:
- Better tracking? 

In feature-branch:
    git rebase master

    m1 - m2 - m3 - f1 - f2
