Yarn Benefits:
- Fast | Deterministic | Secure?



















- Yarn pulls in parallel, NpM will pull in linear fashion

Deterministic:
- For same input, the output will always be the same
- npm is not Deterministic
    - can be made deterministic:
        - npm shrinkwrap
        - must be updated with npm update

- yarn is deterministic

- Security -> using SHA-1 (will be less secure now)
