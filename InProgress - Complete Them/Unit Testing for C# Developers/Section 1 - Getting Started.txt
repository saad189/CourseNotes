Automated Testing:
- Write code to test code
- Code : Production Code + Test Code

------------------------------

Benefits of Automated Testing:
- Frequent Tests | Catch bugs before deploying
- Refactoring | Quality

------------------------------

Types of Tests:

1. Unit Test
2. Integration Test
3. End to End Test

Unit Test:
- Test a unit of the application, without a external dependancies

Integration Test:
- Tests the application with its external dependancies
- Longer to execute | Give confidence | Behavior Testing as a whole
- Testing Two classes is considered an integration test | Even though this may be useless
	as they are coupled and will have to be edited again and again on every class change

End To End
- Drives an Application through its UI (Selenium -> End to End Test application)
- Great confidence | Very slow | Brittle

------------------------------

Test Pyrmaid:
	Least | somme | Most
-  Top : E2E | Middle: Integration | Low: Unit 
- Use Unit Tests to test logic
- Integration to Dependancy Check
- E2E for Happy cases

------------------------------

The Tooling:
