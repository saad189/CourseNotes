Unit Testing: [Component Class Only]
- Testing component in Isolation
- Component testing without its template [FakeService, FakeRouter]

Integration Test: [Component + Template]
- Testing component with its template
- Still FakeService | Opinionated Integration Test

End-to-End Tests:
- Slow, but run the entire flow of the applcation
- Fragile, can be broken by a simple change
- Only write them for the key functions of the app (Happy Tests Only please)
