while filtering events:

e.g:

(keyup) = "someMethod($event)"

You can do -> (keyup.enter) to work only with enter
    Checkout other examples as well

<input #email (keyup.enter)="function(email.value)"/>

Shadow DOM:
Prevent style bleeding

ViewEncapsulation:
1. Emulated -> Angular itself ensures ShadowDOM
2. Native -> New scope, ignores all styles not used in the current component
3. None -> No encapsulation, leaked styles
