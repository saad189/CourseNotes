What is Node:

- Runtime Environment for Executing JS
- Great for Prototyping and Agile Development
- Superfast and Highly Scalable
- JavaScript Consistency
- Clearner and More Consistent Code Base
- Large EcoSystem of Open-Source Libraries
- Built on C++
--------------

Node Architecture:
- JS Engine taken out of Browser
- Uses v8 of Google Browser

--------------

Installing Node:
- Install from Node Website (preferred LTS)
- node --version (Check Version)

First Program:
- Write Code
- Run: node app.js
- Node does not contain window object

Notes:
- Single threaded application, only thread is used to serve all
    clients
- Asynch, non-blocking by default, ideal for I/O apps
- Avoid Node for CPU Intensive tasks, (as it is single thread)
- Rather than browser objects (like window, etc...), we have Computer objects
    like File System, Network, OS, etc...
